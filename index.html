                            Hi! I'm Ali Asghar. I am currently pursuing a BS degree in Computer Science, soon to begin my junior year in the Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering at LUMS. I joined LUMS in 2020 and will be graduating in 2024.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love videogames and spend time with my friends mainly by gaming together. I properly started gaming with friends during the COVID-19 break when I used to be at home and could not go out to meet friends. Before that I saw games as mostly just a pass time and did not see it as a way to connect with friends. I have also developed an interest in videogame making and currently have a fellowship at <a href="https://www.mindstormstudios.com/">Mindstorm Studios</a> where I will learn many aspects of game making including game design, art, and programming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because I liked videogames as a pass time since a young age, I have always been into building PCs. I love assembling different pieces of hardware into something that actually works and it gives an unparalleled sense of achievement when I assemble it all and boot it up. It allowed me to learn how to navigate through the system bios and learn more in depth about the inner workings of a computer system including what piece of hardware is responsible for what kind of processing.
